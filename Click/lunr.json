More precisely, they are peak finders, instead of hit finders. The first identify a peak if the snr of this region is higher than threshold, while the poisson model find peaks based on poisson probability . SNR Model The workflow is shown as above: Raw image is smoothed by gaussian filter, users can specify the sigma parameter. Gradient image is calculated from smoothed image. Raw peak candidates will be found by peak_local_max method in scikit-image package. Users can tune min gradient and min distance between two peaks. Raw peaks in invalid region specified in mask will be removed. Locations of remaining valid peaks will be optimized. Optimal peaks with hign snr and proper number of signal pixels will be identified as strong peaks. In snr model, there are 3 approach to calculate snr of peak in a 7 x 7 crop. The difference beween these methods is the definition of signal and backround region. rings approach. Three radii parameter is spcified to define signal region and background region. The signal radius define the signal region and background inner/outer radius describe an annulus of background region. simple approach. The top 20% (user-specified) pixels are signal region, while lowest 70% (user-specified) are background region. adaptive approach. The lowest 70% (user-specified) are backround region, then signal threshold is calcaulated by background region: sig_thres = bg_val + n * sigma_val, where bg_val is the mean value and sigma is standard deviation of background region, n is user-specified parameter (sigma threshold). The noise is defined as the standard deviation of background region, while the signal is defined as the mean value of signal region minus mean value of background value. Finally, snr is calculated by signal divided by noise. Poisson Model Poisson model assume the photon count follows the Poisson distribution. For a pixel with background value $b$, the probability of photon count $K$: $P_{b}(K)={e^{-b}b^{K}}\\Big/{K!}$. We can define a photon threshold $K^{*}$, by the cummulative probability: $$K^{*}=\\text{argmin}\\sum_{K=0}^{K^{*}}P_{b}(K)1-\\epsilon$$ where $\\epsilon$ is set to very small number, e.g. $10^{-5}$. If the photon count of this pixel is higher than this threshold, it’s assumed as signal pixel. Any connected signal region will be considered as peak candidates for further screening. The workflow of poisson model is shown as above: Convert raw image to photon image, where raw image record signal in adu and photon image in photon count. Calculate threshold image according to poisson distribution. Background value is calculated by averaging photon counts located in the same ring with outliers rejected. Calculate label image. Set label image pixel to 1 if photon image pixel is higher than threshold, otherwise 0. Find all connected regions of 1 in label image as raw peak candidates.

The lowest 70% (user-specified) are backround region, then signal threshold is calcaulated by background region: sig_thres = bg_val + n * sigma_val, where bg_val is the mean value and sigma is standard deviation of background region, n is user-specified parameter (sigma threshold). The noise is defined as the standard deviation of background region, while the signal is defined as the mean value of signal region minus mean value of background value.

For a pixel with background value $b$, the probability of photon count $K$: $P_{b}(K)={e^{-b}b^{K}}\\Big/{K!}$. We can define a photon threshold $K^{*}$, by the cummulative probability: $$K^{*}=\\text{argmin}\\sum_{K=0}^{K^{*}}P_{b}(K)1-\\epsilon$$ where $\\epsilon$ is set to very small number, e.g. $10^{-5}$. If the photon count of this pixel is higher than this threshold, it&#x2019;s assumed as signal pixel. Any connected signal region will be considered as peak candidates for further screening. The workflow of poisson model is shown as above: Convert raw image to photon image, where raw image record signal in adu and photon image in photon count. Calculate threshold image according to poisson distribution. Background value is calculated by averaging photon counts located in the same ring with outliers rejected. Calculate label image. Set label image pixel to 1 if photon image pixel is higher than threshold, otherwise 0. Find all connected regions of 1 in label image as raw peak candidates. Remove bad peaks (located in mask region, too big or too small). Optimize locations of remaining peaks."},"index.html":{"title":"Click","path":"/Click/index.html","body":"Click Click is a Data Preprocessor for SX (Serial Crystallograph) experiments.

Otherwise it may prompt a dialog, then users can select a dataset for visualization. Users can also right click the data item and select select and load dataset in the popup menu.

Users need create proxy data before analysis. Just click File - Create Proxy Data(LCLS) , then input the experiment id, detector name and other parameters in the popup dialog, click Apply to create those files. If you don’t know your experiment id, check LCLS Contral &amp; Data System or ask beamline scientists. For detector name, you can use detnames tool: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 source /reg/g/psdm/etc/psconda.sh detnames exp=your_exp:run=run_num # output example --------------------------------------------------- Full Name | DAQ Alias | User Alias --------------------------------------------------- CxiEndstation.0:Acqiris.0 | Acqiris | NoDetector.0:Evr.1 | evr1 | CxiSc1.0:Opal1000.0 | Sc1OffAxis | CxiDs1.0:Cspad.0 | DscCsPad | CxiDsu.0:Opal1000.0 | Timetool | ControlData | | --------------------------------------------------- Data Visualization To visualize and analyze data in the main window, users need add data files to the File List . After data files added into the File List, double click one data item. If it’s a single-dataset format, like npy, Click will load and display it directly. Otherwise it may prompt a dialog, then users can select a dataset for visualization. Users can also right click the data item and select select and load dataset in the popup menu. Mask Preperation Usually mask is created from a mean/sigma image, which is generated from multiple frames of raw data(right click a data item and select calculate mean/sigma , the result file will be saved in mean folder in your project). Users can select a threshold to generate the initial mask, then refine it by morphology operations. Tip : enable mask view by click View - Show Calib/Mask View , then you can visualize the raw image (left) and current mask(right) in the central image viewer. Besides, users can use mask eraser to make an arbitrary shape of mask( DO NOT use mask eraser and morphology operation at the same time, it will be too slow), this is very handy to make a beam stop mask. Finally, users can multiply multiple mask to generate a combined mask. Hit finding parameters tuning Hit finding parameters tuning is the core function of Click, it’s also the premise of peak powder generation. Users can try different hit finder ( SNR model and Poisson model ) and adjust parameters in real time. Found peaks will be plotted in green circles in the central image viewer. A proper mask can be set to ignore invalid region. Once parameters tuning done, users can save the configuration file in conf/hit_finding folder. Tip : open pixel inspector and peak table to check the peak finding results. Batch Job System Before you submit batch jobs, check the settings of Click. If you are working at LCLS, make sure the Facility is set to LCLS and Job Engine is set to lcls in the General tab of setting dialog. The raw data directory is the root folder of raw data, just leave it empty if you are working at LCLS. In batch settings, users can select configuration file of hit finding and minimal peak numbers for a hit. If all the settings are fine, click Window - Job Table to start batch job system. Right click any row in the job table, select run hit finder to perform hit finding job for this run. When the a hit finding job is done, users can save all to cxi for further analysis. Besides, users can click view stats to check hit finding results of this run."},"LCLS-tutorial.html#LCLS-Tutorial":{"title":"LCLS Tutorial","path":"/Click/LCLS-tutorial.html#LCLS-Tutorial","body":""},"LCLS-tutorial.html#Environment-Setup":{"title":"Environment Setup","path":"/Click/LCLS-tutorial.html#Environment-Setup","body":"LCLS stores raw data in XTC format, which we could not read directly like hdf5 or numpy files, so we use psana API to read raw data.
