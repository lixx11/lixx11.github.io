More precisely, they are peak finders, instead of hit finders. The first identify a peak if the snr of this region is higher than threshold, while the poisson model find peaks based on poisson probability . SNR Model The workflow is shown as above: Raw image is smoothed by gaussian filter, users can specify the sigma parameter. Gradient image is calculated from smoothed image. Raw peak candidates will be found by peak_local_max method in scikit-image package. Users can tune min gradient and min distance between two peaks. Raw peaks in invalid region specified in mask will be removed. Locations of remaining valid peaks will be optimized. Optimal peaks with hign snr and proper number of signal pixels will be identified as strong peaks. In snr model, there are 3 approach to calculate snr of peak in a 7 x 7 crop. The difference beween these methods is the definition of signal and backround region. rings approach. Three radii parameter is spcified to define signal region and background region. The signal radius define the signal region and background inner/outer radius describe an annulus of background region. simple approach. The top 20% (user-specified) pixels are signal region, while lowest 70% (user-specified) are background region. adaptive approach. The lowest 70% (user-specified) are backround region, then signal threshold is calcaulated by background region: sig_thres = bg_val + n * sigma_val, where bg_val is the mean value and sigma is standard deviation of background region, n is user-specified parameter (sigma threshold). The noise is defined as the standard deviation of background region, while the signal is defined as the mean value of signal region minus mean value of background value. Finally, snr is calculated by signal divided by noise. Poisson Model Poisson model assume the photon count follows the Poisson distribution. For a pixel with background value $b$, the probability of photon count $K$: $P_{b}(K)={e^{-b}b^{K}}\\Big/{K!}$. We can define a photon threshold $K^{*}$, by the cummulative probability: $$K^{*}=\\text{argmin}\\sum_{K=0}^{K^{*}}P_{b}(K)1-\\epsilon$$ where $\\epsilon$ is set to very small number, e.g. $10^{-5}$. If the photon count of this pixel is higher than this threshold, it’s assumed as signal pixel. Any connected signal region will be considered as peak candidates for further screening. The workflow of poisson model is shown as above: Convert raw image to photon image, where raw image record signal in adu and photon image in photon count. Calculate threshold image according to poisson distribution. Background value is calculated by averaging photon counts located in the same ring with outliers rejected. Calculate label image. Set label image pixel to 1 if photon image pixel is higher than threshold, otherwise 0. Find all connected regions of 1 in label image as raw peak candidates.

Otherwise it may prompt a dialog, then users can select a dataset for visualization. Users can also right click the data item and select select and load dataset in the popup menu. Mask Preperation Usually mask is created from a mean/sigma image, which is generated from multiple frames of raw data(right click a data item and select calculate mean/sigma , the result file will be saved in mean folder in your project). Users can select a threshold to generate the initial mask, then refine it by morphology operations.

Finally, users can multiply multiple mask to generate a combined mask. Basic Calibration Users can perform basic calibration (determine beam center) on a powder diffraction dataset in 2 steps: calculate mean/sigma of powder diffraction images adjust center and radii of rings to fit the powder rings of the sigma image Tip : You can fit multiple rings using multiple radii parameters seperated with comma like 200,300,400 Hit finding parameters tuning Hit finding parameters tuning is the core function of Click, it’s also the premise of peak powder generation.

Fitted beam center and tilting angles are shown in the middel. Users can optimize detector distance since we know the lattice parameters of powder sample. In this example, we use LaB6 sample, so the resolution of each powder ring can be calculated as below. ring order hkl resolution/&#xC5; 1 001 4.157 2 011 2.939 3 111 2.400 4 002 2.078 5 012 1.859 6 112 1.697 To optimize the detector distance, double click the resolution cell in statistical table and update to correct value."},"PAL-tutorial.html#Batch-Job-System":{"title":"Batch Job System","path":"/Click/PAL-tutorial.html#Batch-Job-System","body":"Before you submit batch jobs, check the settings of Click.
