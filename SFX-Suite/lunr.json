More precisely, they are peak finders, instead of hit finders. The first identify a peak if the snr of this region is higher than threshold, while the poisson model find peaks based on poisson probability . SNR Model The workflow is shown as above: Raw image is smoothed by gaussian filter, users can specify the sigma parameter. Gradient image is calculated from smoothed image. Raw peak candidates will be found by peak_local_max method in scikit-image package. Users can tune min gradient and min distance between two peaks. Raw peaks in invalid region specified in mask will be removed. Locations of remaining valid peaks will be optimized. Optimal peaks with hign snr and proper number of signal pixels will be identified as strong peaks. In snr model, there are 3 approach to calculate snr of peak in a 7 x 7 crop. The difference beween these methods is the definition of signal and backround region. rings approach. Three radii parameter is spcified to define signal region and background region. The signal radius define the signal region and background inner/outer radius describe an annulus of background region. simple approach. The top 20% (user-specified) pixels are signal region, while lowest 70% (user-specified) are background region. adaptive approach. The lowest 70% (user-specified) are backround region, then signal threshold is calcaulated by background region: sig_thres = bg_val + n * sigma_val, where bg_val is the mean value and sigma is standard deviation of background region, n is user-specified parameter (sigma threshold). The noise is defined as the standard deviation of background region, while the signal is defined as the mean value of signal region minus mean value of background value. Finally, snr is calculated by signal divided by noise. Poisson Model Poisson model assume the photon count follows the Poisson distribution. For a pixel with background value $b$, the probability of photon count $K$: $P_{b}(K)={e^{-b}b^{K}}\\Big/{K!}$. We can define a photon threshold $K^{*}$, by the cummulative probability: $$K^{*}=\\text{argmin}\\sum_{K=0}^{K^{*}}P_{b}(K)1-\\epsilon$$ where $\\epsilon$ is set to very small number, e.g. $10^{-5}$. If the photon count of this pixel is higher than this threshold, it’s assumed as signal pixel. Any connected signal region will be considered as peak candidates for further screening. The workflow of poisson model is shown as above: Convert raw image to photon image, where raw image record signal in adu and photon image in photon count. Calculate threshold image according to poisson distribution. Background value is calculated by averaging photon counts located in the same ring with outliers rejected. Calculate label image.

Users can view scientific data in format of npy, npz, h5 (cxi is also hdf5 format, but designed with set of rules), build mask, generate peak powder, make basic calibration and most importantly, tune parameters for hit finding. Even if you are only interested in visulization, you can still try with this module. Layout Main window consistes of File List , Info Panel , Status Panel , Viewer Panel , Parameter Tuning Panel and Image Viewer . Since main window is based on data visualization, the central part image viewer plays the most important role to display image data and flexiable interaction support via mouse(thanks to pyqtgraph). Image Viewer Actually, there are 3 image viewers in main window. Usually users only see one – raw image viewer, which displays the original data of the specified file and dataset. Sometimes people may be interesed in another two viewers: calib/mask viewer (for calibration and mask building) and debug viewer (for debugging). Users can go to View tab in menu bar to show or hide these two viewers. In any viewer, users can zoom in/out or move image very easily. Besides, features include: histogram of image data with movable region defining the dark/light levels. tunable color bar and upper/lower limit. pixel information displayed in status bar. File List File list stores all the files in current session. To add new file(s) to file list, you can: Click File - Add File…, then select file via file browser. Drag and drop files to file list. Input pathname pattern in input box under file list. Once you have file items in file list, you can right click one or some of them, then you can select action in the pop-up menu. select and load dataset : select any 2d or 3d dataset in this file for visualization. set as mask : set this file as mask (only support npy format). multiply masks : combine multiple mask files (only support npy format). calculate mean/sigma : calculate mean and sigma image from all selected files. generate peak powder : build peak powder from all selected files. delete file(s) : remove selected files. Info Panel Info panel displays information with timestamp while SFX-Suite is running, so users don’t need switch to terminal for debugging. Status Panel Status panel shows basic information of current file, including filepath, dataset, mask file, image shape and number of frames. Viewer Panel Viewer panel gives user some basic control of image viewer to: change frame. show center or not. enable auto range/level/histgram_range or not. Parameter Tuning Panel Parameter tuning panel consists of calib/mask and hit finder tabs, giving user quick and real-time response of corresponding task. calib/mask tab To determine the center of images, usually we calculate mean/sigma image or peak powder from multiple data file, which can be done easily via file list. Once the prepration work is done, load the file and edit radii of rings (in pixels and separated by commas) to add some rings to match circles in raw image viewer. You can tune the center x/y to fit the experimental data. To make mask, it’ll be helpful to look at the calib/mask viewer. Click View - Show Calib/Mask View to open second image viewer at right of the raw image viewer. The calib/mask viewer displays binary image where 0 means invalid, and 1 means valid pixel. The mask is generated by 3 steps. threshold cut-off. Pixel with value higher than threshold in raw image is set to valid pixels. morphology operation. Mask of first step will be processed by 3 morphology operations, first erosion, then dilation, and finaly, another erosion. eraser mask. User can draw arbitrary mask using eraser mask tool.
